# Modern Basic book

A simplified book/'dissertation template' with prettier layout options to give it a modern look-and-feel and predefined features for books and translated books.

## About the original template

The original template was created by the ILLC in Amsterdam by Maarten de Rijke, which made its way to FUB where I adapted it for the dissertations there, and from there to a modern layout with features more typical of books. 

## Adaptations to FUBCS

I took that FUBCS guide and gave it a modern look-and-feel a while ago. Some of the changes include the following aspects.

Added:
- An option for translation and notes thereto
- Biographical sketches rather than a CV and publications
- Image on the front page, though nowadays there are better options
- both footnotes and endnotes
- natbib
- spacing

Modified:
- index heading
- more annotations in the tex on how and where to customise
- simplified text in the chapters, assuming a mainly text-based usage
- did not show, though could be used, other features, such as the abstract and a list of symbols.

Removed:
- The core explanatory text that has many small subsections rather than giving the look-and-fee of swathes of text. See FUBCSguide for those details.
