# Book and dissertation templates

*Latex templates enhancing its book class*

This repo currently contains three templates that are intended for writing dissertations, books, and textbooks. I created them by adapting other freely available templates whilst writing books. Each folder has a template-specific readme with more details.


## About the templates


- **SnazzyTextbook**: an extended version of Legrand Orange Book with plenty features geared towards writing textbooks, such as environments for learning outcomes, exercises, vocabulary highlights etc.
- **ModernBasicBook**: simple and elegant book template mainly focussed at writing text where typical dissertation template features are adapted, such as a 'bio sketch section' rather than a 'CV & publications', placeholders for translation information, footnotes and endnotes, and a modern look-and-feel. 
- **FUBCSguide**: an old adaptation of the ILLC template to computer science at the Free University of Bozen-Bolzano, with placeholders for content in the three languages of the faculty and a few other tweaks, such as improved presentation and annotations for easier use.


## Examples

Examples are provided in the respective subfolders named "example", both as pdf of the typesetted main file and a screenshot of a page for an initial impression. The respective readme files also have links to files where I've used the template to write stuff (my PhD dissertation, the ontology engineering textbook (2nd ed.), and a booklet I translated).
