## About the original template

The original template was created by the ILLC in Amsterdam by Maarten de Rijke, which made its way to FUB where I adapted it for the dissertations. 

## Adaptations for FUBCS

I took that FUBCS guide and gave it a modern look-and-feel a while ago. Some of the changes include the following aspects.

Added:
- multilingual is assumed and accommodated, with FUB being a quadrilingual university
- adaptations to Computer Science at FUB (meanwhile outdated so if you're at FUB, update images and faculty name accordingly)
- basic, standard, and modern variants
- other enhancements for easy customisation, such as fancy header and more captioning options

Modified:
- more annotations in the tex on how and where to customise matters


## Examples

The examples/guideFUB.pdf are the respective typesetted guideFUB.tex that can be used as a template to start from, each with slight variations in layout. That guide also has plenty of explanations.

For a complete document typesetted with actual content, you could take a trip to the library or search for theses of CS@FUB graduates. Mine is available online here: http://www.meteck.org/files/AFormalTheoryOfGranularity_CMK08.pdf.
