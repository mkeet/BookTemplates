# Snazzy Textbook Template

A template that makes a textbook look professionally made. It has a monochrome structure specification and many useful textbook features already defined, such as learning outcomes, review questions, exercises, sidebars, vocabulary entries, parts, appendices, and so on.

## About the original template

Igor Machado Coelho, who made pandoc-template-legrand-orange-book-main took the original Legrand Orange Book from: https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/the-legrand-orange-book-template-english/jtctyfmnpppc. His metadata about that:

> **Author:** Mathias Legrand and Vel
> **License:** Other (as stated in the work)
> **Abstract:** The Legrand Orange Book LaTeX Template Version 2.1.1 (14/2/16)
> This template has been downloaded from: LaTeXTemplates.com
> Original author: Mathias Legrand (legrand.mathias@gmail.com) with modifications by: Vel (vel@latextemplates.com)
> License: CC BY-NC-SA 3.0

## Adaptations to the original

I used the version packaged in Coelho's extension and made the following changes:

Added:
- learning outcomes
- review questions, answers
- preface an foreword/course outline
- sidebar
- appendix
- code listings

Modified:
- colour customization options
- more annotations in the tex on how and where to customise
- more text in the main.tex to account for the additions and a few extra notes in other places (e.g., regarding citations, text before figure/table.)
- bib entries section

## Examples

The example/example.pdf is the typesetted main.tex.

The green theme was used for the interior of the second edition of "An introduction to ontology engineering". The use of the template where the colour scheme and main images were adapted, and with actual content and working cross-references to the book's exercises, can be viewed here: http://www.meteck.org/teaching/OEbook/OEWorkBook25.pdf (also here, in case your browser throws an error: https://people.cs.uct.ac.za/~mkeet/OEbook/OEWorkBook.pdf).
